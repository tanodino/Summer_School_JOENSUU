- Compute three different indexes (NDWI, ...) - https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/indexdb/
  + For this point, you should looking for how to extract numpy array from a datacube ( array.to_numpy() )
- Create a coloured composite from the 3 indexes at a spatial resolution of 50 m
