- Select a zone of interest (i.e. the same you selected yesterday)
- Create a data cube for this zone with only one time stamp
- Select a spatial subportion of your area with the slice operator
- Compute three different indexes (NDWI, ...) - https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/indexdb/
  + For this point, you should looking for how to extract numpy array from a datacube ( array.to_numpy() )
  + Or you can explore the function .concat - https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.concat.html - that allows you merge xarray
 - Create a coloured composite from the 3 indexes at a spatial resolution of 50 m
