    "Sentinel-2 uses the concept of tiles. A Sentinel-2 tile delimits an area of 100x100 kmÂ². Each tile has a unique code. The tile that our area of interest falls in is the tile 31TEJ (often times the T is added in front: T31TEJ). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As an aside this code can be found in `s2:mgrs_tile` and as part of the `s2:granule_id` coordinate of our array. More information on the naming conventions used by Sentinel-2 can be found [here](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/naming-convention#:~:text=The%20top%2Dlevel%20SENTINEL%2D2,separated%20by%20an%20underscore%20(_).&text=The%20Mission%20Identifier%20(MMM)%20denotes,for%20the%20SENTINEL%2D2B%20instrument.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to capture an image in the area delimited by the tile 31TEJ the satellite has to fly over the area along an orbit. For tile 31TEJ this orbit is orbit 8. But in order to ensure that there exists overlap between the tiles, data is actually captured with some overlap in a 110x110 kmÂ² area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is now the explanation for the two orbits. The images we see with orbit 108 actually correspond to the acquisition for a different, neighboring tile 31TJG. But since there is overlap between the two images, a small area near the edge of tile 31TEJ is covered by the acquisitions made with orbit 108.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are situations in which having to match the exact values is not desirable. Date objects are usually given with a high degree of precision, and it is not practical having to always specify hours minutes and seconds in situations where the date would suffice. There are a few tools which help alleviate this annoyance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is that Xarray uses the same logic as pandas for its date indexes. Even though the values are datetime64 objects, they can be selected with regular strings with a lot of convenience. For instance \"`2023`\" will correctly match all datetime64 objects between `2023-01-01T00:00:00` and `2023-12-31T23:59:59`, and `2023-01` will correctly match all datetime64 objects of the January 2023, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other tool is the ability of the `sel` method to select inexact matches. This behavior is not limited to time dimensions, but it is particularly applicable for dates. By default, `sel` only matches exact values. However the `method` parameter can enable inexact matches:\n",
    " - `pad` or `ffill` will match the nearest value below\n",
    " - `backfill` or `bfill` will match the nearest value above\n",
    " - `nearest` will match the nearest value\n",
    "\n",
    " Another parameter of `sel` is `tolerance`. It allows to set a limit on the distance between the specified value and a possible match. For dates it can used with a `timedelta64` objet or a string like `'5D'` (5 days), `'5M3W'` (5 months 3 weeks), `'2Y15h34s'`(2 years 15 hours and 34 seconds), etc.\n"
